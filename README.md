### First Trial: Design to Code with the help of AIs

As I've explained myself from the first page, I am an UX designer.
Main tool for my job has been visualization tools, representatively there's Figma in our times also Adobe is the major one for sure that I've been using for my entire design life.

To be honest, since I started to work with digital products (2019, probably), deep underneath somewhere in my head, I've always thought "Code-literacy is the essence to do this job".
I always felt under qualified whenever I showcased my design to senior developers and PMs who seemed to have much more profound knowledge on it. 
This fuzzy disencouraged state of mind always somehow led me towards Not-Good ending, even though no body has complained about my code-literacy. 
The very 'imposter syndrome' has been always around me. 

This trial is, so to encourage or convince myself that actually my fear is not real. 
I would design @Figma, work it on cursor to code it, and then finally, publish it here.

### For it I would be utilizing:
Figma MCP, CursorAI, Tailwind. ChatGPT

Wish me good luck. 
See you with updates.
